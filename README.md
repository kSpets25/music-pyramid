# Music Pyramid - Search and save a personal list of similar bands.

## About Music Pyramid
Music Pyramid was born out of a simple frustration shared by many music fans: finding new bands that truly resonate with the sound of the artist you already love. In a household full of music lovers, discovering similar music and keeping track of it in one easy place, proved to be more difficult than expected. After researching existing solutions, it became clear that while many applications allow you to search for and save music, few focus on helping listeners find and explore similar bands in an engaging way. This inspired the creation of Music Pyramid, an application dedicated to helping you, find, listen to, and log new music based on the bands you already enjoy.

On the Similar Bands Page you can search for similar bands you already enjoy listening to. Enter a band name and a list of similar bands will appear for you to explore. 

## Every band you save is stored in your account so you can revisit them anytime in the My Bands page.

At anytime you can delete a bank from your "My Bands" page.

## About This Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

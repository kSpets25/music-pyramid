## About Music Pyramid
Music Pyramid was born out of a simple frustration shared by many music enthusiastas: finding new bands that truly resonate with the sound of the artist you already love. In a household full of music lovers, discovering similar music and keeping track of it in one easy place, proved to be more difficult than expected. After researching existing solutions, it beame clear that while many application allow users to search for and Save music, few focus on helping listeners explore similar bands in an engaging and intuitive way. This inspired the create of Music Pyramid, an application deducated to helping users, listen to, and log new music based on the bands they already enjoy. 

On the Similar Bands Page you can search for similar bands you already love. A list of similar bands will appear for users to explore. Every band you save is stored under your account so you can revisit them anytime in the My Bands page.

## About This Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
